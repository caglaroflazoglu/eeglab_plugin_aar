AAR plug-in for EEGLAB
=================

This repository stores the code of the AAR plug-in for [EEGLAB][eeglab] that was
released on 31-10-2008. I am not developing this code anymore but if you report
any major bug I will try to fix it whenever I have time. If you are able to,
I would really appreciate if you fork the repo, fix the bug and make a pull
request.

If you are interested in removing artifacts from EEG time-series, you might find
interesting the [meegpipe][meegpipe] project. You can use [meegpipe][meegpipe]
to do everything you can do with the AAR plug-in and much much more.

## Overview

The AAR plug-in is a collection of [MATLAB][matlab] scripts that implement
several state-of-art (in 2008 anyways...) methods for automatic correction of
ocular and muscular artifacts in the [EEG][eeg]. The capabilities of the toolbox
are briefly described in a fairly outdated tutorial document, which you can get
in [.pdf][tut-pdf], or in [html][tut-html] format.

The toolbox is implemented as an [EEGLAB][eeglab] plug-in, but can also be used
without EEGLAB if you don't need or want to use EEGLAB's GUI. The current
version implements several fully automatic methods to correct ocular ([EOG][eog])
artifacts, and one automatic method to correct muscle ([EMG][emg]) artifacts.

## Installation instructions

1. Install [EEGLAB][eeglab] for MATLAB, if you haven't done so already.

2. Find out EEGLAB's root directory. If you installed EEGLAB properly (which
   includes adding EEGLAB to your MATLAB search path), then you should be able
   to get EEGLAB's root dir using the following command in MATLAB:

    ````matlab
    fileparts(which('eeglab'))
    ````

3. Open a terminal and type:

    ````bash
    cd <EEGLAB_ROOT>/plugins
    git clone git://github.com/germangh/eeglab_plugin_aar aar1.3
    ````
    where `<EEGLAB_ROOT>` should be replaced by the path to EEGLAB's root
    directory.

4. Optionally, you may want to install few additional [BSS][bss] algorithms that
   will be automatically detected by the AAR plug-in as long as they are in
   MATLAB's search path:

   * Cardoso's JADE: http://www.tsi.enst.fr/~cardoso/Algo/Jade/jadeR.m
   * Hyvarinen's FastICA: http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/ica/fastica/

the performance of some of the methods included in the AAR toolbox.

## Known issues

- The algorithm for EMG correction which is based on the criterion
`emg_psd` requires MATLAB's Signal Processing Toolbox v.6.2 or newer.
We do not expect to solve this issue in the near future.

- There exist small differences between the correction results obtained
under MATLAB v7.4 and Signal Processing Toolbox v6.6 and the results
obtained under previous MATLAB releases. Nevertheless, the differences
found so far are very small (negligible with respect to typical EEG
noise levels). The probable cause are the changes that were introduced
in MATLAB's SPT toolbox v6.6.

- There exist very small differences between the correction results
obtain under MATLAB v7.4 for Windows and MATLAB v7.4 for Linux. Again,
the differences are well below typical EEG noise levels. The causes of
these differences are unknown and I have no plans of investigating this further.
