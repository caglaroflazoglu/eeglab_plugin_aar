=================

This repository stores the code of the AAR plug-in for [EEGLAB][eeglab] that was
released on 31-10-2008. I am not developing this code anymore but if you report
any major bug I will try to fix it whenever I have time. If you are able to,
I would really appreciate if you fork the repo, fix the bug and make a pull
request.

If you are interested in removing artifacts from EEG time-series, you might find
interesting the [meegpipe][meegpipe] project. You can use [meegpipe][meegpipe]
to do everything you can do with the AAR plug-in and much much more.

## Overview

The AAR plug-in is a collection of [MATLAB][matlab] scripts that implement
several state-of-art (in 2008 anyways...) methods for automatic correction of
ocular and muscular artifacts in the [EEG]. The capabilities of the toolbox are
briefly described in a fairly outdated [tutorial document][tutorial] in .pdf
format.

[tutorial]: http://kasku.org/pubs/aardoc07.pdf

The toolbox is implemented as an [EEGLAB][eeglab] plug-in, but can also be used
without EEGLAB if you don't need or want to use EEGLAB's GUI. The current
version implments several fully automatic methods to correct ocular ([EOG][eog])
artifacts, and one automatic method to correct muscle ([EMG][emg]) artifacts.

For suggestions, comments and bug reports, please contact [German

## Installation instructions

1. Install [EEGLAB][eeglab] for MATLAB, if you haven't done so already.

2. Find out EEGLAB's root directory. If you installed EEGLAB properly (which
   includes adding EEGLAB to your MATLAB search path), then you should be able
   to get EEGLAB's root dir using the following command in MATLAB:

````matlab
    fileparts(which('eeglab'))
````

3. Open a terminal and type:

````bash
    cd <EEGLAB_ROOT>/plugins
    git clone git://github.com/germangh/eeglab_plugin_aar aar1.3
````
